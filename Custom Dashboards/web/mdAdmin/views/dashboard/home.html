<h3>Welcome to Mango's Custom Dashboards Module</h3>

<p>Custom Dashboards are a powerful way to create dynamic visualization screens for your customers.  They are designed to both impress and offer superior functionality and performance.  The development environment is designed for rapid development and deployment.</p>

<p>You can explore the examples and tutorials with the menu on the left. Start off by fiddling with the live examples, you can then copy and paste
mark-up into the <a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.playArea">play area</a> and save it. Once you have some working dashboard mark-up, go ahead and
<a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.basics.createDashboard">create a dashboard</a>.</p>
