<h1 ma-tr="dashboards.v3.dox.filters"></h1>

<p>We can use <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filter" target="_blank">AngularJS filters</a> to format interpolated values and manipulate values.
    Filters in the HTML always follow the <code ng-non-bindable>{{ expression | filter }}</code> syntax.
    The standard AngularJS filters are available such as <code>number</code> and <code>currency</code> as well as custom filters included with the Dashboards v3 module.</p>

<p>Custom filters include <code>moment</code> and <code>duration</code> for using
<a href="http://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">Moment.js</a> to manipulate dates and durations.</p>
