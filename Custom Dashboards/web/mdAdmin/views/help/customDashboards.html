	<p>If you do not want to create pages within this app you can create your own copy of a dashboard.
	<code>Note:</code> there is much more work involved in creating a custom dashboard and we <code>highly recommend</code> using the <a ui-sref="dashboard.help.customPages">built in page system</a>.
	It is amazing what you will be able to build using just the <code>Mango UI Components, Zero Javascript,</code> and the built in <code>CMS</code>!
	Using the built in <code>CMS</code> is the method we will be continuing to support and will evolve over time with even more features.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You will need to work over <code>FTP</code> if  Mango is live on a server and a <code>Desktop Code Editor</code> if working on a local machine.
	The advantage is you can write your own javascript controllers and directives and extend our framework with your own <code>AngularJS</code> components.
	To create your own dashboard, copy one of the <a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.templates.angularMaterial">templates</a>
	into a new folder in <code>${MA_HOME}/overrides/web/modules/dashboards/web</code> and rename the HTML file to <code>index.html</code>.</p>

	<p>There is also a complete <em>Material Design</em> <a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.templates.adminTemplate">admin template</a>
	similar to this web app, with a menu which you can customize using javascript.</p>

	<p>Once you have created a folder in overrides, your dashboard will be accessible at
	<a href="/user-dashboards/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME" target="_blank">/user-dashboards/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME</a>.

	<p>
		You will then need to update the loader script at the bottom of the index.html file.
		Replace <code>require(['dashboards/adminTemplate/app']);</code> with <code>require(['dashboards/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME/app']);</code>.
	</p>

	You can change the Custom Dashboards link on the Mango menu bar to point to your new dashboard in the
	<a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.systemSettings" target="_blank">System settings</a>.</p>

	<p>Once you have a working template you can start <a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.playArea">playing around</a> with the live
	examples and copy and paste them into your template HTML file.</p>
