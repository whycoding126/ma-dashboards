* @ngdoc service
* @name maServices.DeviceName
*
* @description
* Provides a service for getting list of device names from the Mango system.
* - Used by <a ui-sref="dashboard.docs.maDashboards.maDeviceNameList">`<ma-device-name-list>`</a> and <a ui-sref="dashboard.docs.maDashboards.maDeviceNameQuery">`<ma-device-name-query>`</a> directives.
* - All methods return [$resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource) objects that can call the following methods availble to those objects:
*   - `$save`
*   - `$remove`
*   - `$delete`
*   - `$get`
*
* # Usage
*
* <pre prettyprint-mode="javascript">
* var queryResult = DeviceName.byDataSourceXid({xid: $scope.dataSourceXid, contains: $scope.contains});
* </pre>
*
* You can also access the raw `$http` promise via the `$promise` property on the object returned:
* <pre prettyprint-mode="javascript">
* promise = queryResult.$promise.then(function(deviceNames) {
    $scope.deviceNames = deviceNames;
    if ($scope.autoInit && deviceNames.length) {
        $scope.ngModel = deviceNames[0];
    }
});
* </pre>
